## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All rates stored as integer basis points (800 bp = 8%), converted at engine boundary
- Career stage boundaries: Early=[20,30) 1.2x, Mid=[30,45) 1.0x, Late=[45,retirement) 0.6x
- IncomeGrowthEngine is pure static -- no DB imports, no mutable state
- Phases 6-8 are additive extensions (no changes to existing code)
- Deterministic glide paths (rule-based tables, not ML)
- No new bottom tabs (stay at 5); surface via dashboard cards and contextual navigation
- Sinking funds are separate from investment goals (different UX, no inflation/SIP)
- Savings allocation is advisory only (no auto-create transactions)

### GAP Remediation Plan

- C7 (projection engine): Resolved in Phase 6 via INCOME-03
- C10 (balance snapshots): Resolved in Phase 10 via RATE-03
- M5 (goal-investment linking): Resolved in Phase 8 via PURCH-03

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- C1 (SQLCipher): All new tables encrypted at rest (same DB), but no verification test exists yet
- C5 (Lock screen): Planning data is sensitive; lock screen should be verified before Phase 6
